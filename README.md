# Number Sequence 

By starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite set of numbers can be produced. How would you write a function that, given a number, tries to find a sequence of such additions and multiplications that produces that number?

## Assumptions: 
- Program designed to handle positive Integers
- If a sequence is found, print the sequence
- If no sequence is possible, print NO SEQUENCE
- Search is performed using Pre-order traversal

## Enhancements: 
- Includes JUnit test cases for multiple scenarios

## Scope for improvement:  
- Largest number tested was 3215 with a processing time of 8.2 seconds; 
- Program should be handle to larger numbers
